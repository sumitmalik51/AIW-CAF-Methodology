# Exercise 2: Azure Web Application Firewall on Application Gateway

### Overview

Azure Firewall is a managed, cloud-based network security service that protects your Azure Virtual Network resources. It's a fully stateful firewall as a service with built-in high availability and unrestricted cloud scalability. To learn more about Azure Firewall refer: `https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/firewall`

Azure Application Gateway is a web traffic load balancer that enables you to manage traffic to your web applications. Traditional load balancers operate at the transport layer (OSI layer 4 - TCP and UDP). To learn more about Application gateway refer: `https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-gateway`

In this exercise, you will deploy an Azure Firewall and Application Gateway with WAF V2 then you will publish an application through it. You'll also test the application for security and perform a sample attack.

This exercise includes the following tasks:

  - Configure WAF to Protect your web application
  - Publish your application to the internet with the application gateway
  - Monitor attacks against your web application
  - Customize WAF rules
  - Attack simulation

 # Task 1: Configure WAF to Protect your web application

1. Now, you can observe the total number of network traffic flows from **Traffic Visualization**

    > **Note**: The dashboard may take up to 30 minutes to appear when deployed for the first time. This is because Traffic Analytics must first aggregate enough data for it to derive meaningful insights. If it takes more time, you can perform the next task and can come back later and check on this
      
      ![traffic visualization](/images1/traffic%20visualisation.png)
     
1. Under **Traffic Analytics** Scroll down to **Your Environment** to view the total number of **Deployed Azure regions (1)**, **TA Enabled NSGs (2)**, **Virtual networks (3)**, and **Virtual subnetworks (4)**.

    ![see more](/images1/trafficdistri.png)
    
1. Under **Details of top 5 talking IPs**, select VM IP to explore more about traffic distribution.

     ![see more](/images1/top5.png)
     
1. Close the **Traffic distribution across top IPs** by clicking the **cross (X) icon** at the top-left corner of the page.
    
1. In the same way, you can explore more about **Malicious traffic**, and **Blocked traffic** 

1. Now scroll down to **Application ports**, to view analytics for application ports utilized across your environment and select **See all**.

    ![ap](/images1/applicationports.png)
     
1. From the **Most frequent L7 protocols** page, you can explore more about the ports and their ranging.

    ![l7](/images1/l7proto.png)
     
     
### Task 4: Customize WAF rules
 
 In this task, you will configure the Custom rules for firewall policy and will publish the web application within the VM and from Local computer to check the application reachability.
 
 1. Within the **Jump VM**, type **cmd (1)** in the search bar and right-click on **Command Prompt (2)** then click on **Run as administrator (3)**.
 
      ![](/images1/cmd1.png)

      ![](/images/image314.png)
 
 1. In the Azure portal, search **WAF (1)** and then select **Web Application Firewall policies (WAF) (2)**.
 
      ![](images/image302.png "select gateway")
 
 1. On the WAF page, select your **firewallpolicy (1)**, and under settings, click on **Custom rules (2)** and after that click on **+ Add custom rule (3)**.
 
      ![](images/image303.png "select gateway")
 
 1. On the **Add custom rule** blade, enter the following details

    - Priority : enter **1 (2)**.
    - IP address or range: Enter **IPv4 Address (3)** that is copied above in step 2
    - Click on **Add (4)**.
 
      ![](images/image304.png "select gateway")
 
 1. Click on **Save**.
 
      ![](images/image305.png "select gateway")

  1. Once the custom rule is created you will see the notification that says **Successfully updated the WAF policy**, as shown below.
 
      ![](images/image306.png "select gateway")
 
 1.  Now, open a new tab in the Jump VM and browse the **IPv4 Address**.
 
     > **Note**: you will see that your website is Running.

 
      ![ss](/images1/0.0.png)
 
 1. Now, you can paste the **IPv4 Address** in your **Local computer / Personal computer**. You can  observe the **This site can’t be reached error**
 
      > **Note**: You will see that your website is Blocked outside the Jump VM
 
     ![ss](/images1/site.png)

 ### Task 5: Attack simulation 
     
In this task, you will be testing your application for security and performing sample attacks like XSS. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser-side script, to a different end-user.

   > **Note**: You can perform this task only after finishing task 2 and task 3.

1. You can perform a sample attack on your application by passing this `?q=<script>` value at the end of the web application URL or IP address.
    
1. Now pass the value `?q=<script>` at the end of your **Application Gateway** IP and try browsing it. You can observe the web application can be still accessible.
  
   > **Note** : Your browsing URL value should look ```http://20.185.224.102/?q=<script>```
    
   ![ss](/images1/attack.png)
  
1. To make your application more secure, select **ApplicationGateway** from the overview page of the resource group.
     
   ![rp](/images1/rgappgateway.png)
    
1. Under the **Application gateway** page, follow the below details:
     - Select **Web application firewall (1)** under **Settings**    
     - Click on **firewallpolicy** under **Associated web application firewall policy (2)**   
  
     ![config](/images1/webappfirewall.png)
 
1. Under the **firewallpolicy** page, go to the **Overview (1)** tab and click on **Switch to prevention mode (2)**.
 
    ![](/images1/switchtoprevention.png)
    
1. Now, navigate back to the tab where you browsed the IP Address and refresh the page. You can observe the **403 Forbidden error**.
    
    ![server error](/images1/403.png)
