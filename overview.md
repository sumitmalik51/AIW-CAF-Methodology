# Overview

## **Lab Context**

In this hands-on lab, you will explore and implement Azure Security features like Microsoft Defender for Cloud,Web Application Firewall, and Azure sentinal and combining this architecture to configure and protect an IaaS web server hosted on a Windows virtual machine. At the end of the lab, attendees will have knowledge on how to implement and configure these Azure security features.

## **Exercise 1: Azure Security Center/ Microsoft Defender for Cloud**

In this exercise, you will explore on Microsoft Defender for Cloud, configuring Security Policies. Then you will fix the resources by Securing the score and Improving the Secure Posture. You will also explore on Security Center and Security benchmark. Microsoft Defender for Cloud is a Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) and Cloud Workload Protection Platform (CWPP) for all your Azure, on-premises, and multicoloured (Amazon AWS and Google GCP) resources.

## **Exercise 2: Azure Web Application Firewall on Application Gateway**

In this exercise, you will deploy an Azure Firewall and Application Gateway with WAF V2 then you will publish an application through it. You'll also test the application for security and perform a sample attack. Azure Firewall is a managed, cloud-based network security service that protects your Azure Virtual Network resources. It's a fully stateful firewall as a service with built-in high availability and unrestricted cloud scalability. Azure Application Gateway is a web traffic load balancer that enables you to manage traffic to your web applications.Azure Web Application Firewall provides centralized protection of your web applications from common exploits and vulnerabilities. Web applications are increasingly targeted by malicious attacks that exploit commonly known vulnerabilities. SQL injection and cross-site scripting are among the most common attacks. Preventing such attacks in application code is challenging. It can require rigorous maintenance, patching, and monitoring at multiple layers of the application topology. A centralized web application firewall helps make security management much simpler.

## **Exercise 3: Azure Firewall Premium**

In this exercise, you will configure and explore the Azure Firewall premium features. Azure Firewall Premium is a next generation firewall with capabilities that are required for highly sensitive and regulated environments. It includes the following features like TLS Inspection, IDPS, URL filtering, and Web categories.

## **Exercise 4: Azure Sentinel**

In this exercise, you will explore Azure Sentinel, learn about onboarding Azure subscriptions, IaaS server that is a web app, and explore query logs. Microsoft Sentinel is a scalable, cloud-native solution that provides SIEM (Security information and event management) and SOAR (Security orchestration, automation, and response).
